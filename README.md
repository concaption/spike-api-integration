Created a minimalistic health data application that leverages FastAPI for the backend, Google Sheets for data storage, and Spike API for health data collection. The application features a Dockerized environment and is organized into a modular structure with a clear separation of concerns for API, models, and utilities. It provides end-to-end solutions for user authentication, data collection, and storage in a seamless manner. The app is hosted on Railway, making it easily accessible and scalable.

### **Deliverables**

- Dockerized FastAPI backend application.
- Integration with Google Sheets for data storage.
- Spike API integration for collecting health metrics.
- User authentication and provider selection through FastAPI routes.
- A responsive frontend built with Bootstrap.
- A modular code structure with clear separation into API, models, and utilities.
- Makefile for simplified project setup and maintenance.
- Deployment on Railway for easy access and scalability.

The project is a showcase of my capabilities in API integration, data management, backend development, and deployment, providing a comprehensive solution for health data collection and storage.
